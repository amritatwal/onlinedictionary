#### Description

wordsearch is an online word lookup served by an external API. This is an enhanced version of an application my partner and I made during the second week of School of Code during a Hackathon. The purpose was to create an application that requested data from an external API using our ability to make fetch requests so to build on our foundational JavaScript knowledge. 

This application is a reworked, tidied up and more dynamic version of the application we made found [here](https://i.ibb.co/cv3nzPg/Screenshot-2022-03-06-at-10-05-20.png). 

#### What I learnt, what I enjoyed and what was challenging
    - Explain what you learnt, any goals achieved and how
    - Goals you are aiming for (with future features, sprints, releases)
    - Teamwork (evidence)
5. **What you could improve on**
6. **Screenshots and/or a demo**
    - This is super useful as a visual aid
7. **Is it hosted?** If so, provide a link
8. **Tech stack**
    - It’s important to note why the stack was chosen to explain intentionality behind it
9. **Key features**
    - Why does the project stand out and why should people use it?
10. **Approach**
    - Explain why you did something the way you did it as it shows intentionality, also note any design patterns and styles used
11. **Status**
    - If it’s still in development then it would be useful to note
12. **Testing**
    - Has it been tested and if so, how would one run the tests?
13. Accessbility and responsivenss 
14. **Requirements**:
    - Does the project need anything to work? Modules, libraries…
    - People need you to be transparent whether anything needs to be installed before attempting to use or run the project
15. **Installation**
    - It may not always be obvious and it needs to be clear to the user how to use it
    - If the instructions are complex or again lengthy then it would be beneficial to create a .txt file just for the installation guidelines/process
16. **Troubleshooting/FAQs**
    - This will depend on the complexity of the project and it would be useful to refer to should people encounter issues
17. **Bugs**
    - If people want to flag bugs how could they do that?
18. **Contribution guidelines**
19. **Credit**
    - Who helped you? Were you inspired from someone or something?
20. **Licensing**
