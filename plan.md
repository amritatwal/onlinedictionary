## Step 2 - Break down the problem (20 - 30 mins)

Now that you have an understanding of what data you're working with and have come up with an idea of what you could achieve, break down the problem into smaller chunks. Keep breaking the problem down until you can translate your plan into code. You should dream big, break it down, and start small. If your plan turns out to be overly ambitious, then be smart and reign it in. If you've been too conservative, try and push yourself.

# Plan

// HTML + CSS





// JS

1. User inputs word into input box
   - Word is entered in box and user presses enter key    // *** done ***
   - Add event listener to input box to capture event // *** done *** 
   - real time input/display on screen
   - Word is saved as a variable
 - 
  
2. Depending on word, retrieve info from JSON object > 
    - Create async function and fetch info from API
    - Store data in variable
    - ... Validity check of some sort - prints a string...

3. Target the DOM
    - Use queryselector to select H1 and change it to word
    - Use queryselector to select p elements to display correct definitions etc
    - 

4. Window dressing!
    - add an h2 for the current word definitions displayed
